**Collaboration**
\
We all decided to meet physically and worked on one of our laptops. We tried to switch the laptops from one session to another, so that everyone gets to push/commit. All the team members have exchanged roles and have worked on all the weeks' tasks and all the sub-divsions of the final project.
